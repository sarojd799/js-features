1.Every object in javascript inherits properties from some object using prototype.
2.Prototype chain ends when the object has prototype as null

*)To access prototype in practice
1.all browsers use __proto__
2.The standard way is Object.getPrototypeOf()

*.When you try to access a property the property is search throughout prototype chain.If still not found then returns undefined.
